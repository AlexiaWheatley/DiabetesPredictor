Using data science to predict the risk of diabetes in adults: A machine learning approach for early diagnosis and prevention.

Diabetes mellitus remains a growing public health concern worldwide, with its prevalence rapidly increasing across both developed and developing nations. Early detection possibilities and focused treatment has made Data Science and machine learning particularly a popular tool for identifying diabetes risk. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic illness that can be prevented. It is frequently misdiagnosed or undetected until complications develop. Traditional screening techniques are effective but rely on biochemical testing and clinical evaluation which are resource-intensive and not scalable in environments with limited resources.
ML algorithms can assess large amounts of health data which can/will include blood pressure, glucose levels, age, BMI and lifestyle factors to accurately forecast the risk of diabetes according to numerous researchers. The Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset has been extensively utilized for training and assessing models such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Decision Trees and Logistic Regression. (Smith, et al., 1988)
The validation of collective learning models that perform better in predictions that traditional statistical models is a significant addition from recent research. For example, (I, et al., 2017) found that combining clinical data with machine learning techniques improved diabetes prediction accuracy and output(Area Under Curve) values.

This project explores the application of machine learning models to predict the risk of diabetes in adults, using secondary data to build a reliable early warning system. The approach aims to assist healthcare practitioners and policymakers in adopting data-driven interventions for better resource allocation and targeted health campaigns.
